# Data Set Information:

The experiments have been carried out with a group of 30 volunteers within an age bracket of 19-48 years. Each person performed six activities (WALKING, WALKING_UPSTAIRS, WALKING_DOWNSTAIRS, SITTING, STANDING, LAYING) wearing a smartphone (Samsung Galaxy S II) on the waist. Using its embedded accelerometer and gyroscope, we captured 3-axial linear acceleration and 3-axial angular velocity at a constant rate of 50Hz. The experiments have been video-recorded to label the data manually. The obtained dataset has been randomly partitioned into two sets, where 70% of the volunteers was selected for generating the training data and 30% the test data. The sensor signals (accelerometer and gyroscope) were pre-processed by applying noise filters and then sampled in fixed-width sliding windows of 2.56 sec and 50% overlap (128 readings/window). The sensor acceleration signal, which has gravitational and body motion components, was separated using a Butterworth low-pass filter into body acceleration and gravity. The gravitational force is assumed to have only low frequency components, therefore a filter with 0.3 Hz cutoff frequency was used. From each window, a vector of features was obtained by calculating variables from the time and frequency domain.

# Attribute Information:

For each record in the dataset it is provided: 
- Triaxial acceleration from the accelerometer (total acceleration) and the estimated body acceleration. 
- Triaxial Angular velocity from the gyroscope. 
- A 561-feature vector with time and frequency domain variables. 
- Its activity label. 
- An identifier of the subject who carried out the experiment.


# Workflow
## Initial work
 - set working directory to the location of data
 - read 8 data sets from text files that contain the test, and train data, labeling, etc.
 - Name the column names appropriately

## Task 1: Merges the training and the test sets to create one data set.
- use `cbind()` function to create final train and test datasets by binding x, y and subject datasets for train and test

## Task 2: Extracts only the measurements on the mean and standard deviation for each measurement.
- identify the column names that contain information about means and SDs using regular expressions.
- create a new data set with only those columns.

## Task 3: Uses descriptive activity names to name the activities in the data set
 - lookup activity name using activity name/id matrix using `merge()` function.

## Task 4: Appropriately labels the data set with descriptive variable names.
 - rename column names/labels to more appropriate names using `gsub()` function.
 
## Task 5: From the data set in step 4, creates a second, independent tidy data set with the average of each variable for each activity and each subject.
 - use `data.table` package to calculate mean of each variable by aggregating on activity ID and subject ID
